Traditionally, music is played by reading soundwaves left to right. This is a python script that allows users to submit a .wav file, rotate the soundwave by any degree, and listen (left to right) to the result. 

This resorts in heavy distortion for any angles >0.1 degrees, with the exception of 180 degrees (this reverses the .wav). Listening to music at large degrees also has the effect that the duration is heavily shortened.
